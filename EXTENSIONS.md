Just a few to consider for implentation, not sure all are a must but a number of them are perfect. React-native-art seems like the perfect solution for our welcome screen graphics, there are a few preset libraries for stat wheel graphics. Hopefully we would use these in combination with the modal extension which is for improved animations.

I also came across iconic, an icon animation library which adds some very clean looking animations to a set of icons, currently it only have a limited set of animated icons but could be useful for a small section of the application. Similar art style to feather icon pack. When looking at Ui-kitten's library it did also suggest an icon pack from the Eva Design System which is very similar to feather but with a larger range of icons, worth looking at as a group.

Autocomplete for text input, especially when we are going to have users adding ingredients and suggesting options so we don't have duplicates of items in the database. This would call the datasets we have already created. Would need to work with Josh to get this library to work correctly but the documentation is extensive.
